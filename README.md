# Mandelbrot Set Generator

## Overview

This Python script allows you to generate the Mandelbrot set using the moderngl library. You can explore different aspects of the Mandelbrot set by adjusting various parameters.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following packages installed:

- moderngl
- moderngl-window

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install moderngl moderngl-window
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ymankh/mandelbrot_set.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory.

```bash
cd mandelbrot-generator
```

3. Run the Python script.

```bash
python mandelbrot.py
```

## Controls

- **Z and X**: Zoom in and out of the fractal.
- **P and O**: Change the power of the fractal.
- **L and K**: Increase and decrease the accuracy (number of iterations).
- **M**: Change the fractal.
- **A, W, S, D**: Move in the four directions (left, up, down, right).

Feel free to experiment with these controls to explore the beautiful world of the Mandelbrot set.
